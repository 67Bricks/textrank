Open source Java implementation of the TextRank algorithm by Mihalcea,
et al. Note that this code only implements key phrase extraction based
on keyword co-occurance described in section 3 of the Mihalcea-Tarau
paper. This code does not yet implement the sentence extraction
described in section 4 of that paper.
