# Overview

This is a Java implementation of the TextRank algorithm by Mihalcea, et al.
It only implements key phrase extraction based on keyword co-occurrence described in section 3 of the Mihalcea-Tarau
paper. This code does not yet implement the sentence extraction described in section 4 of that paper.
